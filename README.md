# Colorblind Seals

This is a texture replacement mod for the seals in Balatro. Because I am
colorblind, I had a hard time differentiating between the blue and purple seals
on the cards in hand, which led to discarding cards I should have kept and vice
versa.

The textures for the seals are altered by this mod to all have unique shape for
easier differentiation.


## Prerequisites
Other than Balatro itself, the following tools and mods are required:

0. [Lovely](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector) (Lua injector, required for Steamodded)
1. [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded) (mod loader, required for Malverk)
2. [Malverk](https://github.com/Eremel/Malverk) (texture pack manager, required for _this_ mod)

## Installation
Like any other Steamodded-based Balatro mod, put this mod in the `Mods`
directory in the Balatro `AppData` directory, alongside Steamodded and Malverk.
